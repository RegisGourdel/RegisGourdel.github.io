## About

I am a post-doctoral researcher in finance and sustainability at the Geneva Finance Research Institute, and resident researcher at the Department of Finance of the University of Zurich.

I apply methods from complexity economics and post-Keynesian economics to better understand the effect of climate risk on the economy and the financial system in particular.
I have also developed the European Central Bank's ISA model for system-wide stress-testing.
