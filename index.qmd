## About

I am a post-doctoral researcher in financial economics and sustainability.
I apply methods from complexity economics and post-Keynesian economics to better understand the effect of climate risk on the economy and the financial system in particular.
I have worked on the development of the European Central Bank's ISA model for system-wide stress-testing, as well as the stock-flow consistent EIRIN model.
