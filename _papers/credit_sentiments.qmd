###### Abstract:
The role of banks in supporting the low-carbon transition has proved controversial as they have priced climate transition risk but maintained investment in polluting industries.
This paper provides first a theoretical benchmark for the carbon premium, based on a formalization of the concept of climate sentiments, the policy-dependent present value of firms' capital, and the Merton model.
I find that the current empirical evidence for carbon premia matches a reasonable calibration of investment dynamics in productive capital, with a limited space for higher premia even when banks strongly expect future climate-mitigation policies.
Second, I consider discrepancies in climate sentiments between lenders and borrowers, to determine when banks could push reticent borrowers to green their operations, or prevent them from doing so.
I find that variations in the cost of debt due to the carbon premium are generally not enough of a decarbonization incentive alone.
Macro-prudential measures that complement carbon pricing and policies that limit the lending volume would then be necessary to decarbonize the economy further through the financial system.
