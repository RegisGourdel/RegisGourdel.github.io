###### Abstract
Barbados is a country highly exposed to climate physical risks and to transition risks, where the latter could emerge as a result of a domestic disorderly transition, and from the introduction of climate policies by trading partners.
Nevertheless, we still know little about the implications of climate scenarios on sovereign fiscal and financial stability.
We contribute to filling this gap by studying the macroeconomic and public finance impacts of climate risks.
It includes transition spillover risk, driven by the introduction of climate policies globally, which decrease international tourist arrivals to curb CO~2~ emissions from flights, coherently with transition scenarios for aviation.
It also accounts for chronic and acute physical climate risks, with the latter given by a country-specific model for tropical cyclones, calibrated on past meteorological data from the Caribbean region.
To conduct our analysis, we tailor the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model, and we calibrate it to the Barbadian economy.
First, we find a potentially significant reduction of the Barbadian GDP due to transition spillover risk: up to 37.6% less in 2050, as a deviation from a business-as-usual path of touristic inflows.
This further harms the debt-to-GDP ratio and debt sustainability.
Second, implementing domestic climate policies may decrease GHG emissions by up to 75\%.
Importantly, the economic costs of decarbonization are smaller than the costs of unabated climate change.
The results suggest that mitigating climate risks would benefit from economic diversification and from tailored financial instruments.
